# Tessera Test Entity

This document describes the Test entity type in Tessera.

## Overview

Tests are verification and validation protocols that ensure your product meets its requirements. Tessera supports both verification tests (did we build it right?) and validation tests (did we build the right thing?).

## Entity Type

- **Prefix**: `TEST`
- **File extension**: `.tdt.yaml`
- **Directories**:
  - `verification/protocols/` - Verification test protocols
  - `validation/protocols/` - Validation test protocols

## Test Types

### Verification vs Validation

| Type | Purpose | Question Answered |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| **Verification** | Confirms design outputs meet design inputs | Did we build it right? |
| **Validation** | Confirms product meets user needs | Did we build the right thing? |

### V-Model Test Levels

Tests follow the V-model hierarchy:

```
User Needs              ←→  Acceptance Testing (validation)
    ↓                           ↑
System Requirements     ←→  System Testing
    ↓                           ↑
Architecture Design     ←→  Integration Testing
    ↓                           ↑
Detailed Design         ←→  Unit Testing
```

| Level | Tests Against | Scope |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| **Unit** | Detailed design | Individual components |
| **Integration** | Architecture design | Component interactions |
| **System** | System requirements | Complete system |
| **Acceptance** | User needs | End-user scenarios |

### IADT Methods

Choose the appropriate verification method:

| Method | Description | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Inspection** | Visual examination of product/documentation | Workmanship, labeling, documentation |
| **Analysis** | Calculation, modeling, or simulation | Complex systems, safety-critical |
| **Demonstration** | Show functionality works | User interface, simple operations |
| **Test** | Measured execution under controlled conditions | Performance, environmental, stress |

### Delete or archive a test

```bash
# Permanently delete (checks for incoming links first)
tdt test delete TEST@1

# Force delete even if referenced by results
tdt test delete TEST@1 --force

# Specify who executed the test
tdt test run TEST@1 --verdict pass --by "John Smith"

# Add notes
tdt test run TEST@1 --verdict pass --notes "Minor overshoot during ramp"

# Open result in editor for full details
tdt test run TEST@1 --verdict pass --edit

# Output result ID only (for scripting)
tdt test run TEST@1 --verdict pass -f id
```

**Example Output:**

```
✓ Created result RSLT@5 for test TEST@3 "Housing Dimensional Inspection"
   Verdict: pass
   Executed by: John Smith
   verification/results/RSLT-01JEH7QXYZ123456789ABCDEFG.tdt.yaml
```

**Notes:**
- Results are saved to `verification/results/` or `validation/results/` based on the test type
- A new RSLT entity is created and linked to the test
- Use `tdt rslt edit RSLT@N` to add step results, measurements, and attachments

## Validation

Tests are validated against a JSON Schema. Run validation with:

```bash
# Validate all project files
tdt validate

# Validate specific file
tdt validate verification/protocols/TEST-01HC2JB7SMQX7RS1Y0GFKBHPTF.tdt.yaml
```

### Validation Rules

1. **ID Format**: Must match `TEST-[A-Z0-9]{26}` pattern
2. **Type**: Must be `verification` or `validation`
3. **Test Level**: If specified, must be `unit`, `integration`, `system`, or `acceptance`
4. **Test Method**: If specified, must be `inspection`, `analysis`, `demonstration`, or `test`
5. **Status**: Must be one of: `draft`, `review`, `approved`, `released`, `obsolete`
6. **Priority**: Must be one of: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`
7. **Procedure Steps**: Must have `step` (integer) and `action` (string)
8. **No Additional Properties**: Unknown fields are not allowed

## Traceability

```bash
# Show verification coverage
tdt trace coverage

# Show uncovered requirements
tdt trace coverage --uncovered

# Trace what a test verifies
tdt trace from TEST-01HC2

# Find tests that verify a requirement
tdt trace to REQ-01HC2
```

## Best Practices

### Writing Test Procedures

1. **Be specific** - Include exact settings, values, and conditions
2. **Include acceptance criteria** - Define pass/fail for each step
3. **Document equipment** - List required equipment with specifications
4. **Specify preconditions** - Document everything needed before starting
5. **Consider edge cases** - Test boundary conditions

### Organizing Tests

1. **One test per protocol** - Keep tests focused and atomic
2. **Use categories** - Group related tests
3. **Use tags** - Enable cross-cutting filtering
4. **Link to requirements** - Maintain traceability
5. **Separate verification from validation** - Use appropriate directories

### Test Level Guidelines

| Level | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| **Unit** | Testing individual components in isolation |
| **Integration** | Testing component interactions |
| **System** | Testing complete system against requirements |
| **Acceptance** | Validating against user needs |

### Method Selection Guidelines

| Method | Best For |
|--------|----------|
| **Inspection** | Physical attributes, labeling, documentation |
| **Analysis** | Mathematical proof, simulation, modeling |
| **Demonstration** | Operational functionality, user workflows |
| **Test** | Quantitative measurement, performance limits |
