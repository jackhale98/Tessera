# Tessera Mate Entity (Tolerances)

This document describes the Mate entity type in Tessera.

## Overview

Mates represent 1:1 contact relationships between two features, such as a pin fitting into a hole. Tessera automatically calculates worst-case fit analysis when you create or recalculate a mate, determining whether it's a clearance, interference, or transition fit.

**Auto-detection**: Tessera automatically determines which feature is the hole and which is the shaft based on their `internal` field - no need to remember which order to link them!

## Entity Type

- **Prefix**: `MATE`
- **File extension**: `.tdt.yaml`
- **Directory**: `tolerances/mates/`

## Fit Calculation

Tessera automatically calculates worst-case fit from the primary dimensions of both features. The `internal` field on each feature's dimension determines which is treated as the hole and which as the shaft:

- **Internal feature** (`internal: true`): Treated as the hole
- **External feature** (`internal: false`): Treated as the shaft

### Worst-Case Analysis

```
Auto-detection from internal field:
  if feature_a.internal AND NOT feature_b.internal:
    hole = feature_a, shaft = feature_b
  else if NOT feature_a.internal AND feature_b.internal:
    hole = feature_b, shaft = feature_a
  else:
    ERROR: Both features must have opposite internal/external designation

Calculation:
  hole_max = hole.nominal + hole.plus_tol      # LMC for hole
  hole_min = hole.nominal - hole.minus_tol     # MMC for hole
  shaft_max = shaft.nominal + shaft.plus_tol   # MMC for shaft
  shaft_min = shaft.nominal - shaft.minus_tol  # LMC for shaft

  min_clearance = hole_min - shaft_max   # MMC hole - MMC shaft
  max_clearance = hole_max - shaft_min   # LMC hole - LMC shaft

  fit_result =
    if min_clearance > 0: clearance
    else if max_clearance < 0: interference
    else: transition
```

### Statistical (RSS) Analysis

Optional statistical analysis calculates the probability of interference:

```
# Feature statistics (assuming ±3σ process, sigma_level = 6.0)
hole_mean = hole.nominal + (hole.plus_tol - hole.minus_tol) / 2
hole_sigma = (hole.plus_tol + hole.minus_tol) / sigma_level

shaft_mean = shaft.nominal + (shaft.plus_tol - shaft.minus_tol) / 2
shaft_sigma = (shaft.plus_tol + shaft.minus_tol) / sigma_level

# Clearance distribution
mean_clearance = hole_mean - shaft_mean
sigma_clearance = sqrt(hole_sigma^2 + shaft_sigma^2)

# Interference probability (using normal CDF)
P(interference) = Φ(-mean_clearance / sigma_clearance) × 100%

# 3σ limits
clearance_3sigma_min = mean_clearance - 3 * sigma_clearance
clearance_3sigma_max = mean_clearance + 3 * sigma_clearance
```

**Use when**: Need to understand interference probability for transition fits, or when worst-case analysis is too conservative.

**Important**: A mate requires one internal feature (hole) and one external feature (shaft). Tessera will report an error during validation if both features have the same `internal` value.

## Fit Types

### Clearance Fit

Both min and max clearances are positive - shaft always fits freely in hole.

```
min_clearance > 0 AND max_clearance > 0
```

**Applications**: Easy assembly, sliding fits, running clearance

### Interference Fit (Press Fit)

Both min and max clearances are negative - shaft is always larger than hole.

```
min_clearance < 0 AND max_clearance < 0
```

**Applications**: Permanent assembly, torque transmission, press-fit pins

### Transition Fit

Min clearance is negative but max clearance is positive - may be either clearance or interference depending on actual dimensions.

```
min_clearance < 0 AND max_clearance > 0
```

**Applications**: Locating fits, accurate positioning with some assembly force

## ISO Fit Classifications

| Fit Type | ISO Symbol | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Loose running | H11/c11 | Large clearance for free movement |
| Free running | H9/d9 | Light running with minimal friction |
| Close running | H8/f7 | Accurate location with free movement |
| Sliding | H7/g6 | Accurate location, can slide |
| Locational clearance | H7/h6 | Accurate location, snug fit |
| Locational transition | H7/k6 | Accurate location, light press |
| Locational interference | H7/n6 | Accurate location, press fit |
| Medium drive | H7/p6 | Permanent assembly |
| Force fit | H7/s6 | High interference |

## Best Practices

### Creating Mates

1. **Set internal field** - Ensure each feature has the correct `internal` field (true for holes, false for shafts)
2. **Feature order doesn't matter** - Tessera auto-detects hole vs shaft from the `internal` field
3. **Complete features first** - Ensure both features have dimensions before creating mate
4. **Verify fit type** - Check that calculated fit matches your intent
5. **Document rationale** - Explain why this fit was chosen

### Managing Mates

1. **Recalculate after changes** - Run `tdt mate recalc` after modifying features
2. **Link to requirements** - Connect to requirements that specify fit
3. **Use in stackups** - Reference mates in tolerance stackups
4. **Track status** - Update status as design matures

### Fit Selection Guidelines

| Application | Recommended Fit |
|-------------|-----------------|
| High-speed rotation | Clearance |
| Sliding/reciprocating | Clearance |
| Accurate positioning | Transition |
| Light press assembly | Transition |
| Permanent assembly | Interference |
| Torque transmission | Interference |

## Validation

Mates are validated against a JSON Schema:

```bash
# Validate all project files
tdt validate

# Validate specific file
tdt validate tolerances/mates/MATE-01HC2JB7SMQX7RS1Y0GFKBHPTF.tdt.yaml
```

### Validation Rules

1. **ID Format**: Must match `MATE-[A-Z0-9]{26}` pattern
2. **Feature A**: Required, `feature_a.id` must reference a valid FEAT entity
3. **Feature B**: Required, `feature_b.id` must reference a valid FEAT entity
4. **Feature Pairing**: One feature must be internal (hole), one must be external (shaft)
5. **Cached Info Sync**: Cached `name` and `component_id` must match actual feature values
6. **Title**: Required, 1-200 characters
7. **Mate Type**: If specified, must be valid enum
8. **Fit Result**: If specified, must be `clearance`, `interference`, or `transition`
9. **Fit Analysis Sync**: Stored `fit_analysis` must match calculated values from features
10. **Status**: Must be one of: `draft`, `review`, `approved`, `released`, `obsolete`
11. **No Additional Properties**: Unknown fields are not allowed

### Fixing Out-of-Sync Mates

If feature dimensions or metadata have changed, mates may be out of sync:

```bash
# Check for validation issues
tdt validate

# Example warnings:
# ! MATE-01HC2... - validation warning(s)
#     fit_analysis mismatch: stored (0.03 to 0.17) vs calculated (0.02 to 0.18)
#     feature_a has stale cached name 'Old Name' (feature is 'Mounting Hole')

# Auto-fix fit_analysis and cached values
tdt validate --fix
```

The `--fix` flag will:
- Recalculate and update `fit_analysis` values
- Update cached `name` and `component_id` fields to match actual features
