# Tessera Requirements Entity

This document describes the Requirements entity type in Tessera.

## Overview

Requirements are the foundation of product development in Tessera. They capture design inputs (customer needs, regulations, standards) and design outputs (specifications, derived requirements).

## Entity Type

- **Prefix**: `REQ`
- **File extension**: `.tdt.yaml`
- **Directories**:
  - `requirements/inputs/` - Design inputs (customer requirements, regulations)
  - `requirements/outputs/` - Design outputs (specifications, derived requirements)

## Schema

| `id` | string | Unique identifier (REQ-[26-char ULID]) |
| `type` | enum | `input` or `output` |
| `title` | string | Short descriptive title (1-200 chars) |
| `text` | string | Full requirement text |
| `status` | enum | `draft`, `review`, `approved`, `obsolete` |
| `priority` | enum | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical` |

  satisfied_by:
    - REQ-01HC2JB7SMQX7RS1Y0GFKBHPTE  # Thermal design output

## CLI Commands

### Create a new requirement

```bash
# Create with default template
tdt req new

# Create with title and type
tdt req new --title "Operating Temperature Range" --type input

# Create with title, type, and full requirement text
tdt req new --title "Operating Temperature" --type input --text "The device shall operate from -20C to +50C"

# Short form for text
tdt req new --title "Power Input" -t input -x "The device shall accept 12V DC power"

# Create with interactive wizard
tdt req new -i

# Create output requirement with high priority
tdt req new --type output --priority high --title "Thermal Management Spec"
```

### List requirements

```bash
# List all requirements
tdt req list

# Filter by type
tdt req list --type input
tdt req list --type output

# Filter by status
tdt req list --status draft
tdt req list --status approved

# Filter by priority
tdt req list --priority high
tdt req list --priority urgent  # high + critical

# Show orphaned requirements (no links)
tdt req list --orphans

# Show requirements needing review
tdt req list --needs-review

# Show recently created
tdt req list --recent 7  # last 7 days

# Search in title/text
tdt req list --search "temperature"

# Custom columns
tdt req list --columns id,title,status
```

### Show requirement details

```bash
# Show by ID (partial match supported)
tdt req show REQ-01HC2

# Show by title search
tdt req show "temperature"

# Show with linked entities
tdt req show REQ-01HC2 --with-links
```

### Edit a requirement

```bash
# Open in editor
tdt req edit REQ-01HC2
```

### Delete or archive a requirement

```bash
# Permanently delete (checks for incoming links first)
tdt req delete REQ@1

# Force delete even if other entities reference it
tdt req delete REQ@1 --force

# Archive instead of delete (moves to .tdt/archive/)
tdt req archive REQ@1

# Archive with force (skip link check)
tdt req archive REQ@1 --force
```

> **Note:** Delete and archive commands check for incoming links by default. If another entity references the requirement you're trying to delete, the command will fail unless you use `--force`. Archived entities preserve their directory structure within `.tdt/archive/`.

## Validation

Requirements are validated against a JSON Schema. Run validation with:

```bash
# Validate all project files
tdt validate

# Validate specific file
tdt validate requirements/inputs/REQ-01HC2JB7SMQX7RS1Y0GFKBHPTD.tdt.yaml

# Validate only requirements
tdt validate --entity-type req

# Continue after first error
tdt validate --keep-going
```

### Validation Rules

1. **ID Format**: Must match `REQ-[A-Z0-9]{26}` pattern
2. **Type**: Must be `input` or `output`
3. **Title**: Required, 1-200 characters
4. **Text**: Required, non-empty
5. **Status**: Must be one of: `draft`, `review`, `approved`, `obsolete`
6. **Priority**: Must be one of: `low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`
7. **No Additional Properties**: Unknown fields are not allowed

## Link Management

```bash
# Add a link (with reciprocal)
tdt link add REQ-01HC2 REQ-01HC3 satisfied_by -r

# Remove a link
tdt link remove REQ-01HC2 REQ-01HC3 satisfied_by

# Show all links for a requirement
tdt link show REQ-01HC2

# Check for broken links
tdt link check
```

## Traceability

```bash
# Show traceability matrix
tdt trace matrix

# Export as GraphViz DOT
tdt trace matrix -o dot > trace.dot

# Export as CSV
tdt trace matrix -o csv > trace.csv

# Trace what depends on a requirement
tdt trace from REQ-01HC2

# Trace what a requirement depends on
tdt trace to REQ-01HC2

# Find orphaned requirements
tdt trace orphans

# Verification coverage report (part of results summary)
tdt rslt summary

# Show uncovered requirements
tdt rslt summary --uncovered

# Domain Mapping Matrix: requirements vs components
tdt dmm req cmp --stats

# Domain Mapping Matrix: requirements vs tests
tdt dmm req test --stats
```

> **Tip:** Use `tdt dmm req cmp --stats` to quickly see requirement-to-component allocation coverage, or `tdt dmm req test --stats` for verification coverage analysis.

## Best Practices

### Writing Good Requirements

1. **Use "shall"** for mandatory requirements
2. **Use "should"** for recommended requirements
3. **Use "may"** for optional requirements
4. **Be specific and testable** - avoid vague language
5. **One requirement per entity** - don't combine multiple requirements

### Organizing Requirements

1. **Use categories** to group related requirements
2. **Use tags** for cross-cutting concerns
3. **Separate inputs from outputs** in different directories
4. **Link related requirements** with satisfied_by relationships

### Status Workflow

```
draft → review → approved → released
                    ↓           ↓
                 obsolete ← ← ← ┘
```

1. **draft**: Initial creation, still being written
2. **review**: Ready for stakeholder review
3. **approved**: Signed off and baselined
4. **released**: Released to production/manufacturing
5. **obsolete**: No longer applicable (keep for history)

### Priority Guidelines

- **critical**: Safety, regulatory, or blocking requirements
- **high**: Core functionality, key differentiators
- **medium**: Standard features, quality of life
- **low**: Nice to have, future considerations

## JSON Schema

The full JSON Schema for requirements is embedded in Tessera and available at:

```
tdt/schemas/req.schema.json
```

Key schema properties:

- `additionalProperties: false` - No unknown fields allowed
- `minLength` constraints on title and text
- `maxLength: 200` on title
- `format: date-time` on created
- `pattern` validation on ID field
