# Tessera Workflow & Collaboration

This document describes the workflow features in Tessera.

## Overview

Tessera provides workflow commands that help teams collaborate on product data with git-based version control. The commands are designed to be **git-transparent** - users run simple Tessera commands and git operations happen automatically in the background.

**For non-git users**: You just run `tdt approve REQ@1` - Tessera handles all the git operations for you.

**For git users**: All git operations are visible with `--verbose`, and you can always use git commands directly.

## Status Workflow

All Tessera entities follow a common status progression:

```
Draft → Review → Approved → Released
```

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `draft` | Initial state, work in progress |
| `review` | Submitted for review |
| `approved` | Approved by authorized reviewers |
| `released` | Officially released for use |

## Configuration

Enable workflow features in `.tdt/config.yaml`:

```yaml
workflow:
  enabled: true
  provider: github    # github, gitlab, or none
  auto_commit: true   # Auto-commit status changes (recommended)
  auto_merge: false   # Merge PR on approval
  base_branch: main   # Target branch for PRs

  # Default approval requirements (applies to all entity types)
  default_approvals:
    min_approvals: 1
    require_unique_approvers: true

  # Per-entity-type approval requirements
  approvals:
    RISK:
      min_approvals: 2
      required_roles: [engineering, quality]
    REQ:
      min_approvals: 2
    NCR:
      min_approvals: 2
      required_roles: [quality]
```

# View all available config keys
tdt config keys
```

## Team Roster

Define team members and their approval permissions in `.tdt/team.yaml`:

```yaml
version: 1
members:
  - name: "Jane Smith"
    email: "jane@example.com"
    username: "jsmith"
    roles: [engineering, quality]
    signing_format: gpg        # Optional: gpg, ssh, or gitsign
    active: true

  - name: "Bob Wilson"
    email: "bob@example.com"
    username: "bwilson"
    roles: [quality, management]
    signing_format: ssh
    active: true

approval_matrix:
  REQ: [engineering, quality]
  RISK: [quality, management]
  NCR: [quality]
  _release: [management]
```

### Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `engineering` | Can approve technical entities (requirements, components) |
| `quality` | Can approve quality-related entities (risks, NCRs, CAPAs) |
| `management` | Can approve releases and high-level decisions |
| `admin` | Full access to all operations |

### Team Commands

```bash
# Initialize team roster
tdt team init

# Add a team member
tdt team add --name "Jane Smith" --email jane@co.com --username jsmith --roles engineering,quality

# Add a team member with signing format
tdt team add --name "Bob Wilson" --email bob@co.com --username bwilson --roles quality --signing-format ssh

# Remove a team member
tdt team remove jsmith

# List team members
tdt team list

# Check your own role
tdt team whoami
```

### Team Keyring

For signature verification across the team, Tessera stores public keys in `.tdt/keys/`:

```
.tdt/
├── keys/
│   ├── gpg/
│   │   ├── jsmith.asc       # GPG armored public key
│   │   └── bwilson.asc
│   ├── ssh/
│   │   ├── jsmith.pub       # SSH public key
│   │   └── bwilson.pub
│   └── allowed_signers      # Auto-generated for SSH verification
```

**Key Management Commands:**

```bash
# Export your public key to the team keyring
tdt team add-key                          # Auto-detect format from git config
tdt team add-key --method gpg             # Export GPG public key
tdt team add-key --method ssh             # Export SSH public key

# Import GPG keys from team keyring into your local keyring
tdt team import-keys                      # Import all GPG keys
tdt team import-keys --user jsmith        # Import specific user's key

# Regenerate SSH allowed_signers file
tdt team sync-keys
```

**Workflow for new team members:**

1. Configure your signing: `tdt team setup-signing --method ssh`
2. Add yourself to roster: `tdt team add --name "Your Name" --email you@co.com --username you --roles engineering --signing-format ssh`
3. Export your public key: `tdt team add-key`
4. Commit and push the key file
5. Other team members run `tdt team sync-keys` (SSH) or `tdt team import-keys` (GPG)

## Submit Command

Submit entities for review (creates a PR if provider configured):

```bash
# Single entity
tdt submit REQ@1

# Multiple entities
tdt submit REQ@1 REQ@2 RISK@3

# With a message
tdt submit REQ@1 -m "Ready for review"

# Pipe from list command
tdt req list -s draft -f short-id | tdt submit -

# All draft entities of a type
tdt submit --type req --status draft

# Create as draft PR
tdt submit REQ@1 --draft

# Skip PR creation (git only)
tdt submit REQ@1 --no-pr

# Request review from specific users
tdt submit REQ@1 --reviewer jsmith,bwilson
```

### Options

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--message` | `-m` | Submission message |
| `--type` | `-t` | Filter by entity type |
| `--status` | `-s` | Filter by status (default: draft) |
| `--all` | | Submit all matching entities |
| `--no-pr` | | Skip PR creation |
| `--draft` | | Create as draft PR |
| `--reviewer` | `-r` | Request review from specific GitHub/GitLab usernames |
| `--yes` | `-y` | Skip confirmation prompt |
| `--dry-run` | | Show what would be done |
| `--verbose` | `-v` | Print commands as they run |

### What Submit Does

1. Validates entities are in Draft status
2. Creates a feature branch (e.g., `review/REQ-01KCWY20`)
3. Changes status to Review in entity files
4. Commits and pushes changes
5. Creates a PR (if provider configured)
6. Prints the PR URL

## Approve Command

Approve entities under review. This is designed to be simple - just run `tdt approve` and everything is handled automatically:

```bash
# Simple approval
tdt approve REQ@1

# Multiple entities
tdt approve REQ@1 REQ@2 RISK@3

# Approve all entities in a PR
tdt approve --pr 42

# Approve and merge
tdt approve REQ@1 --merge

# With approval message
tdt approve REQ@1 -m "Looks good"

# Check approval status without adding approval
tdt approve REQ@1 --status

# Skip git commit (just update YAML files)
tdt approve REQ@1 --no-commit

# Skip authorization check (admin)
tdt approve REQ@1 --force
```

### Options

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--pr` | | Approve all entities in a PR by number |
| `--message` | `-m` | Approval comment |
| `--merge` | | Merge PR after approval |
| `--no-merge` | | Skip merge even if auto_merge enabled |
| `--no-commit` | | Skip git commit (just update YAML files) |
| `--sign` | `-S` | GPG-sign the approval commit (for Part 11 compliance) |
| `--status` | | Show approval status without adding an approval |
| `--force` | | Skip authorization check |
| `--yes` | `-y` | Skip confirmation prompt |
| `--dry-run` | | Show what would be done |
| `--verbose` | `-v` | Print commands as they run |

### Multi-Signature Approvals

When `min_approvals > 1` is configured for an entity type, approvals are accumulated until the requirements are met:

```bash
# First approval (entity stays in Review status)
$ tdt approve RISK@1 -m "Engineering approval"
  Recorded approval by jsmith for 1 entities
  Committed: "Approve RISK-01KCWY20: Motor failure"
1 entities need more approvals before transitioning to 'approved' status.

# Check current approval status
$ tdt approve RISK@1 --status
RISK-01KCWY20  Motor failure analysis
  Status: review
  Approvals: 1/2
  Approvers: jsmith
  Missing roles: quality
  Need 1 more approval(s)

# Second approval (meets requirements, transitions to Approved)
$ tdt approve RISK@1 -m "Quality approval"
  Recorded approval by bwilson for 1 entities
  Committed: "Approve RISK-01KCWY20: Motor failure"
1 entities fully approved.
```

### What Approve Does

1. **If `--pr` specified**: Fetches and checks out the PR branch automatically
2. Validates entities are in Review status
3. Verifies user has approval authorization (if team roster configured)
4. Checks for duplicate approvals (if require_unique_approvers is enabled)
5. Records approval as an "electronic signature" (approver name, email, role, timestamp)
6. Checks if approval requirements are met for the entity type
7. If requirements met: Changes status to Approved
8. If requirements not met: Entity stays in Review status
9. Commits changes (if git available and auto_commit enabled)
10. **Creates a git tag** for audit trail (e.g., `approve/REQ-01KC.../jsmith/2024-01-15`)
11. **Pushes changes and tags to remote**
12. Adds approval to PR (if provider configured)
13. Optionally merges PR (only if all entities are fully approved)
14. **Restores original branch** (if `--pr` switched branches)

### Approving via PR Number

The recommended way to approve is using the `--pr` flag:

```bash
# Approve all entities in PR #42
tdt approve --pr 42

# This automatically:
# 1. Fetches and checks out the PR branch
# 2. Pulls latest changes
# 3. Makes approval changes
# 4. Commits and pushes
# 5. Adds PR approval
# 6. Returns to your original branch
```

If you have uncommitted changes, use `--yes` to auto-stash them:

```bash
tdt approve --pr 42 --yes  # Auto-stash uncommitted changes
```

### Approval Records (Electronic Signatures)

Each approval is recorded in the entity YAML file as an "electronic signature":

```yaml
approvals:
  - approver: "Jane Smith"
    email: "jane@example.com"
    role: engineering
    timestamp: 2024-01-15T10:30:00Z
    comment: "Reviewed, looks good"
  - approver: "Bob Wilson"
    email: "bob@example.com"
    role: quality
    timestamp: 2024-01-15T14:22:00Z
    comment: "Quality approved"
    signature_verified: true        # GPG signature verified
    signing_key: "ABC123DEF456"     # GPG key ID
```

This provides a complete audit trail of who approved what and when.

## 21 CFR Part 11 Compliance

For FDA-regulated industries (medical devices, pharmaceuticals, biotech), Tessera supports [21 CFR Part 11](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/part-11-electronic-records-electronic-signatures-scope-and-application) compliance through GPG-signed approvals.

### Why GPG Signatures?

Part 11 requires electronic signatures to be:
- **Unique to an individual** - GPG keys are personal and password-protected
- **Verifiable** - Signatures can be cryptographically verified
- **Inextricably linked to the record** - Git commits bind the signature to exact content

Combined with Git's immutable audit trail, this satisfies Part 11's requirements for electronic records and signatures.

### Enabling Part 11 Mode

```yaml
# .tdt/config.yaml
workflow:
  enabled: true
  provider: github

  # Require GPG signatures for all approvals
  default_approvals:
    min_approvals: 2
    require_signature: true

  # Or require signatures only for specific entity types
  approvals:
    RISK:
      min_approvals: 2
      required_roles: [engineering, quality]
      require_signature: true
    REQ:
      min_approvals: 2
      require_signature: true
```

### Using GPG-Signed Approvals

```bash
# Approve with GPG signature
tdt approve REQ@1 --sign

# If require_signature is enabled, --sign is required
tdt approve RISK@1 --sign -m "Quality review complete"
```

### Setting Up Commit Signing

Before using signed approvals, each team member needs to configure commit signing. Tessera supports three signing methods:

| Method | Best For | Key Management | Requirements |
|--------|----------|----------------|--------------|
| **GPG** | Traditional environments, existing PKI | Manual key management | GPG installed |
| **SSH** | Teams already using SSH keys | Use existing SSH keys | Git 2.34+ |
| **gitsign** | Keyless, OIDC-based signing | No key management | gitsign binary, OIDC provider |

#### Option 1: Use Tessera Setup Command (Recommended)

Tessera provides a helper command to configure signing:

```bash
# Check current signing status
tdt team setup-signing --status

# Configure GPG signing (default)
tdt team setup-signing --method gpg
tdt team setup-signing --method gpg --key-id YOUR_KEY_ID

# Configure SSH signing
tdt team setup-signing --method ssh
tdt team setup-signing --method ssh --key-id ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# Configure gitsign (keyless OIDC-based)
tdt team setup-signing --method gitsign

# Configure for this repository only
tdt team setup-signing --local

# Preview without making changes
tdt team setup-signing --method ssh
# (Review the commands, then confirm or add --yes to auto-confirm)
```

#### GPG Signing

GPG is the traditional choice with broad tooling support:

```bash
# Generate a GPG key (if you don't have one)
gpg --full-generate-key

# List your keys to find the key ID
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long

# Configure with TDT
tdt team setup-signing --method gpg --key-id YOUR_KEY_ID
```

**Pros**: Widely supported, works with GitHub/GitLab verified badges
**Cons**: Key management overhead, key expiration, passphrase complexity

#### SSH Signing (Git 2.34+)

SSH signing reuses your existing SSH keys:

```bash
# Use your existing SSH key
tdt team setup-signing --method ssh

# Or specify a key explicitly
tdt team setup-signing --method ssh --key-id ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

**Pros**: No new keys needed, simpler key management, works offline
**Cons**: Requires Git 2.34+, GitHub verification requires uploading signing key separately

Tessera auto-detects SSH keys in common locations (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`, `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`, etc.)

#### gitsign (Keyless OIDC-Based)

gitsign uses your identity provider (Google, GitHub, Microsoft) for signing with signatures logged to Rekor transparency log:

```bash
# Install gitsign first
# macOS: brew install sigstore/tap/gitsign
# Linux: Download from https://github.com/sigstore/gitsign/releases

# Configure with TDT
tdt team setup-signing --method gitsign
```

**Pros**: No key management, identity-based (OIDC), transparency log for audit
**Cons**: Requires internet for signing, less traditional for auditors

**Note**: While auditors may not be familiar with Rekor specifically, they are also unlikely to be experts in Git internals. The transparency log provides an independent audit trail that can be verified without deep Git knowledge.

#### Why Enable Auto-Signing?

When `require_signature: true` is configured for an entity type, Tessera will warn if `commit.gpgsign` is not enabled. Enabling auto-signing ensures:

- **All commits are signed**, not just approval commits
- **All tags are signed**, creating an immutable audit trail
- **No mixed signed/unsigned commits** in your repository
- **Simpler workflow** - no need to remember `--sign` flag

For detailed instructions, see:
- [GitHub: Managing commit signature verification](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification)
- [GitLab: Signing commits with GPG](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/signed_commits/gpg.html)
- [Sigstore gitsign](https://github.com/sigstore/gitsign)

### Part 11 Compliance Checklist

Using Tessera with cryptographic signing (GPG, SSH, or gitsign) satisfies several Part 11 requirements:

| Part 11 Requirement | Tessera Feature |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Audit trail (11.10(e)) | Git commit history with timestamps |
| Unique user identification (§11.100) | Signing keys + team roster |
| Signature meaning (§11.50) | Approval comments and role |
| Non-repudiation (§11.200) | Cryptographic signatures (GPG/SSH/gitsign) |
| Record integrity (§11.10(c)) | Git hash-linked commits |

All three signing methods provide cryptographic proof of identity:
- **GPG**: Traditional PKI with key trust model
- **SSH**: Key-based identity linked to team member
- **gitsign**: OIDC identity (email) with Rekor transparency log

**Note**: Technology alone doesn't ensure compliance. You also need:
- System validation documentation (IQ/OQ/PQ)
- Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
- Training records
- Periodic audits

## Reject Command

Reject entities back to draft status:

```bash
# Single entity with reason
tdt reject REQ@1 -r "Needs more detail"

# Multiple entities
tdt reject REQ@1 REQ@2 -r "Incomplete specifications"

# Reject all entities in a PR
tdt reject --pr 42 -r "Does not meet requirements"
```

### Options

|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--reason` | `-r` | Rejection reason (required) |
| `--pr` | | Reject all entities in a PR |
| `--yes` | `-y` | Skip confirmation prompt |
| `--dry-run` | | Show what would be done |
| `--verbose` | `-v` | Print commands as they run |

### What Reject Does

1. Validates entities are in Review status
2. Changes status back to Draft
3. Records rejection (who, when, reason)
4. Commits changes
5. Closes PR with comment (if provider configured)

## Release Command

```bash
# Single entity
tdt release REQ@1

# Multiple entities
tdt release REQ@1 REQ@2 REQ@3

# All approved requirements
tdt release --type req

# All approved entities
tdt release --all

# Pipe from list
tdt req list -s approved -f short-id | tdt release -
```

3. Changes status to Released
4. Commits with release message
5. **Creates a git tag** for audit trail (e.g., `release/REQ-01KC.../manager/2024-01-16`)

## Review Command

View pending reviews and approval status:

```bash
# List items pending your review (requested as reviewer)
tdt review list

# Filter by entity type
tdt review list -t req

# Show all pending reviews (not just yours)

# Summary of review queue
tdt review summary

# Show entities that need more approvals (multi-signature support)
tdt review pending-approvals

# Filter pending approvals by entity type
tdt review pending-approvals -t risk
```

### Discovering PRs for Multi-Approval Workflows

When using multi-signature approvals, team members may need to find PRs that require their role's approval even if they weren't explicitly requested as a reviewer:

```bash
# Show all open PRs targeting main branch
tdt review list --target main

# Show PRs that need approval from your role
tdt review list --needs-role

# Show all open PRs with Tessera entities
tdt review list --all-open

# Combine with entity type filter
tdt review list --target main -t risk
```

### Review List Options

## Git Tags for Audit Trail

Tessera automatically creates git tags for workflow events:

```bash
# List all approval tags
git tag -l 'approve/*'

# List all release tags
git tag -l 'release/*'

# Filter tags for a specific entity
git tag -l '*REQ-01KC*'

# Show tag details
git show approve/REQ-01KC.../jsmith/2024-01-15
```

### Tag Format

| Event | Tag Format |
|-------|------------|
| Approval | `approve/{entity-short-id}/{approver}/{date}` |
| Release | `release/{entity-short-id}/{releaser}/{date}` |

Example tags:
```
approve/REQ-01KCWY20/jsmith/2024-01-15
approve/RISK-02ABCD/bwilson/2024-01-15
release/REQ-01KCWY20/manager/2024-01-16
```

These tags enable:
- **Audit queries**: `git log --tags='approve/*'`
- **CI/CD integration**: Trigger builds on release tags
- **Compliance reporting**: Query approvals by date range

## Provider Integration

### GitHub

Tessera uses the `gh` CLI for GitHub integration. Install it from https://cli.github.com and authenticate:

```bash
gh auth login
```

Commands used:
- `gh pr create` - Create pull request
- `gh pr review --approve` - Add approval
- `gh pr merge` - Merge PR
- `gh pr list --search "review-requested:@me"` - List pending reviews

### GitLab

Tessera uses the `glab` CLI for GitLab integration. Install it from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli and authenticate:

```bash
glab auth login
```

Commands used:
- `glab mr create` - Create merge request
- `glab mr approve` - Approve MR
- `glab mr merge` - Merge MR
- `glab mr list --reviewer=@me` - List pending reviews

### Manual Mode (No Provider)

Set `provider: none` to use workflow commands without GitHub/GitLab integration:

```bash
tdt submit REQ@1
# → Creates branch, commits, pushes
# → Prints: "Create PR manually at your git provider"
```

## Transparency

All workflow commands support transparency flags:

```bash
# Show what would be done without executing
tdt submit REQ@1 --dry-run

# Print commands as they run
tdt submit REQ@1 --verbose
```

### Example Dry Run

```
$ tdt submit REQ@1 --dry-run

Would execute:
  git checkout -b review/REQ-01KCWY20
  git add requirements/inputs/REQ-01KCWY20.tdt.yaml
  git commit -m "Submit REQ@1: Pump GPM requirement"
  git push -u origin review/REQ-01KCWY20
  gh pr create --title "Submit REQ@1: Pump GPM requirement" --base main

No changes made (dry run).
```

## Full Workflow Example

### Setup

```bash
# Initialize a Tessera project with workflow
tdt init myproject
cd myproject

# Enable workflow with GitHub
tdt config set workflow.enabled true
tdt config set workflow.provider github

# Create team roster
tdt team init
tdt team add --name "Jane Smith" --username jsmith --roles engineering,quality
tdt team add --name "Bob Wilson" --username bwilson --roles quality,management
```

### Author Creates and Submits

```bash
# Create a requirement
tdt req new --title "Pump GPM requirement"

# Submit for review
tdt submit REQ@1 -m "Initial pump requirement"
# → Creates branch, commits, pushes, opens PR #42
```

### Reviewer Approves

```bash
# Check pending reviews
tdt review list
# → Shows REQ@1 pending review

# Approve (with merge)
tdt approve REQ@1 --merge
# → Adds approval to PR #42, merges to main
```

### Manager Releases

```bash
# Release the approved requirement
tdt release REQ@1
# → Status: approved → released
```

## Best Practices

### For Teams New to Git

1. **Just use Tessera commands** - Run `tdt approve`, `tdt submit`, etc. Git happens automatically
2. **Use `--verbose`** - See what git commands are running to learn
3. **Use `--dry-run`** - Preview what will happen before executing

### For Teams

1. **Define clear roles** - Set up team roster with appropriate role assignments
2. **Use PRs for visibility** - Keep provider configured for audit trail
3. **Review before release** - Require approval before releasing entities

### For Solo Developers

1. **Minimal config** - Just enable workflow, skip team roster
2. **Use provider: none** - No GitHub/GitLab dependency needed
3. **Status tracking** - Still get status progression benefits

### Git-Savvy Users

Workflow commands are optional. You can always:

```bash
# Use git directly
git add requirements/inputs/REQ-*.yaml
git commit -m "Add requirements"
git push

# Edit status manually in YAML files
# Create PRs through web UI
```
