# Tessera Result Entity

This document describes the Result entity type in Tessera.

## Overview

Results are execution records of test protocols. They capture the outcome of running a test, including step-by-step results, measurements, deviations, and failures. Results provide objective evidence that testing was performed and document the verdict.

## Entity Type

- **Prefix**: `RSLT`
- **File extension**: `.tdt.yaml`
- **Directories**:
  - `verification/results/` - Results of verification tests
  - `validation/results/` - Results of validation tests

```

## Validation

Results are validated against a JSON Schema. Run validation with:

```bash
# Validate all project files
tdt validate

# Validate specific file
tdt validate verification/results/RSLT-01HC2JB7SMQX7RS1Y0GFKBHPTG.tdt.yaml
```

### Validation Rules

1. **ID Format**: Must match `RSLT-[A-Z0-9]{26}` pattern
2. **Test ID Format**: Must match `TEST-[A-Z0-9]{26}` pattern
3. **Verdict**: Must be `pass`, `fail`, `conditional`, `incomplete`, or `not_applicable`
4. **Step Results**: Must have `step` (integer) and `result` (enum)
5. **Status**: Must be one of: `draft`, `review`, `approved`, `released`, `obsolete`
6. **Dates**: Must be ISO 8601 format
7. **No Additional Properties**: Unknown fields are not allowed

## Workflow

### Typical Result Workflow

1. **Execute Test** - Run the test per the protocol
2. **Create Result** - `tdt rslt new --test TEST-xxx`
3. **Document** - Edit result to add step results, observations
4. **Review** - Submit for peer review (status: review)
5. **Approve** - Sign off on results (status: approved)

### Handling Failures

When a test fails:

1. **Document Failure** - Add to `failures` array with description
2. **Root Cause Analysis** - Document root cause in failure record
3. **Corrective Actions** - Create action items
4. **Link Actions** - Add action IDs to `links.actions`
5. **Retest** - Create new result for retest

### Handling Deviations

When a test passes with deviations:

1. **Set Verdict** - Use `conditional`
2. **Document Deviation** - Add to `deviations` array
3. **Justify** - Explain why deviation is acceptable
4. **Assess Impact** - Document impact on results

## Best Practices

### Documenting Results

1. **Be thorough** - Document everything observed
2. **Include measurements** - Record actual values with min/max
3. **Attach evidence** - Photos, data files, logs
4. **Explain verdicts** - Especially for non-pass results
5. **Track equipment** - Record calibration status

### Organizing Results

1. **One result per execution** - Don't combine multiple test runs
2. **Use consistent naming** - Include test name and run number
3. **Use categories and tags** - Enable filtering
4. **Link to actions** - Maintain traceability for failures
5. **Archive attachments** - Keep data files with results

### Verdict Guidelines

| Scenario | Verdict | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| All criteria met | pass | None |
| Minor non-conformance, documented justification | conditional | Document deviation |
| Any failure without justification | fail | Create action items |
| Test interrupted, cannot complete | incomplete | Reschedule |
| Test does not apply | not_applicable | Document rationale |

## Metrics

Use Tessera to generate testing metrics:

```bash
# Overall pass rate
tdt rslt list --verdict pass --count
tdt rslt list --count

# Failure rate by test
tdt rslt list --test TEST-01HC2 --verdict fail --count

# Recent failures
tdt rslt list --verdict fail --recent 30
```

## JSON Schema

The full JSON Schema for results is embedded in Tessera and available at:

```
tdt/schemas/rslt.schema.json
```
